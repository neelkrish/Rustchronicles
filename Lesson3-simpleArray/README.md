Lets talk about Arrays

touch simpleArray.rs

using you fav editor:
```
// Main function
fn main(){
	let arr:[i32;4] = [1,2,3,4];
    println!("array size is {}",arr.len());
}
```

arr:[i32;4]  -> we are declaring an array of length 4 with 32-bit integers.

Save, compile & Execute
```
rustc simpleArray.rs
./simpleArray
```

Cute! right?! :P
