Rust provides access to a wide variety of primitives.

Oh! Did you just wonder what are primitives? These are fundamental data type that cannot be broken down into a more simple data type. For example, an integer is a primitive data type, while an array, which can store multiple data types, is not.

Scalar Types:

-> signed integers: i8, i16, i32, i64, i128 and isize (pointer size)
-> unsigned integers: u8, u16, u32, u64, u128 and usize (pointer size)
-> floating point: f32, f64
-> char Unicode scalar values like 'a', 'α' and '∞' (4 bytes each)
-> bool either true or false
and the unit type (), whose only possible value is an empty tuple: ()
Despite the value of a unit type being a tuple, it is not considered a compound type because it does not contain multiple values.

Compound Types:
-> arrays like [1, 2, 3]
-> tuples like (1, true)
