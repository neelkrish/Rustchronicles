touch addTwonumber.rs

Using your fav editor:

// Main function
fn main() {
	let a = 100;
    let b = 200;
    println!("Result is {}",a+b);
}

Save and then execute

rustc addTwonumber.rs
./addTwonumber

if you want to assign this sum to another variable "c"

// Main function
fn main() {
        let a = 100;
        let b = 200;
	let c = a+b
    println!("Result is {}",c);
}
 
Awesome job!
